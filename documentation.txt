FILE STRUCTURE ~~~~~~~>

 homePage -> "index.html", 
 resultsPage -> "searchResultPage.html",
 single js file -> "script.js",

 PROJECT DESCRIPTION ~~~~~~~>


--> I have integrated the custom Google search API in this Application to fetch data  It has  ※ 100  request Limit per Day --> status code 429 if quota exceeds

--> The homepage(index.html) is divided into three parts: header, main and footer (semantic HTML) -> ensures web assessability

--> The main section contains the search field, which is used to search for anything the user wants

--> When the user types into the search field with the help of the onKeydown event attribute it is listening to each keyPress so,

--> When the user presses the enter key or clicks on the "Google search" button it calls the fetchData function which uses fetch API to get the required result

--> Storing the result into the LocalStorage so that we do not lost it on Page change

--> Then with the help of the location API of the browser it redirects to the "searchResultPage.html" page from the homePage "index.html"

--> With the help of the event listener listening to page change (DOMContentLoaded) on page change getting data from LocalStorage and calling the displaySearchResult() function

--> Then by iterating through the items array of result Object (that we get as a response from  API) render the first 10 items into the UI
